# Remaining Work

## ROCm Dockerfile validation
- Verify TheRock nightly URL is stable and correct
- Apply vLLM build patches for RDNA4 support
- End-to-end test on RDNA4 hardware (9070 XT)
- Validate flash-attention triton backend on gfx1201

## Benchmarking phase (Phase 6)
- Implement benchmark API endpoints (currently stubbed)
- Token throughput measurement (tokens/sec, TTFT, ITL)
- Store and display benchmark history per model
- Compare results across quantization methods

## Chat UI
- vLLM does not ship a chat interface
- Build or embed a lightweight chat UI
- Support streaming responses via SSE
- Tool use / function calling display in chat

## Model served name mismatch
- vLLM uses full filesystem paths as model identifiers
- Clients need to know the exact served name to send requests
- /v1/models proxy now forwards to vLLM when running (shows actual paths)
- Consider adding --served-model-name flag support in per-model config

## Polish
- Show friendly error on service page when vLLM crashes mid-request
- Model delete confirmation should check if the model is currently running
- Improve error messages when model files are corrupted or incomplete
- Loading states for long operations (model scan, large downloads)

## Setup script enhancements
- Add `enable` / `disable` commands for auto-start (from llama-toolchest)
- Support `setup.sh update` to pull latest image
- Validate GPU driver availability during install

## Multi-GPU testing
- Test tensor parallelism with TP=2 and TP=4
- Validate GPU memory utilization settings across multiple GPUs
- Document multi-GPU configuration

## Agent CLI tool
- Port llama-toolchest's cmd/agent to work with vLLM
- CLI tool for piping prompts to the local vLLM instance
- Support tool use / function calling from the command line
